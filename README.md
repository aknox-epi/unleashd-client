## Development Workflow

This project uses a **modified GitHub Flow** for development. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed workflow.

### Branch Structure

- **`main`** - Production code, receives updates from `dev` only
- **`dev`** - Current source of truth, all feature work branches from here
- **Feature branches** - Short-lived branches created from `dev`, merged back to `dev`

### Quick Start

1. **Start from dev:**

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature"
   ```

   Commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   - `feat:` - New feature
   - `fix:` - Bug fix
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Test additions
   - `style:` - Code formatting
   - `perf:` - Performance improvements

3. **Push and create PR:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Then open a Pull Request against `dev` on GitHub.

4. **Review and merge:**
   - Wait for CI checks to pass
   - Get review approval (if required)
   - Create and get release approval
   - Merge via GitHub into `dev`
   - Delete the feature branch
   - Pull latest `dev`: `git checkout dev && git pull origin dev`

## Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses Husky and lint-staged to automatically:

- Run ESLint and auto-fix issues
- Format code with Prettier
- Validate commit messages with commitlint

Hooks run automatically on `git commit`. To bypass (not recommended):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions automatically runs on all PRs and pushes to `dev` and `main`:

- **Lint & Test:** ESLint, Prettier check, Jest tests
- **Build:** Web export to verify build process
- **Commitlint:** Validates commit messages

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for configuration.
